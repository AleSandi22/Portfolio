    <p class="description">I'm a web developer. I have experience in projects with Javascript and Typescript, using frameworks as Angular, Vue js and React js. I like to learn and relearn about different technologies and tools. Also, I investigate about what I don't know and what I know, because there always exist something new to learn.</p>
